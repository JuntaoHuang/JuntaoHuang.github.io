My research is mainly focused on scientific computing, numerical analysis and scientific machine learning. Topics of special interests include:

- Structure-preserving machine learning moment closures for kinetic models
- Adaptive sparse grid discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for high-dimensional PDEs
- Structure-preserving time discretizations for hyperbolic balance laws
- High order numerical boundary conditions for hyperbolic equations
- Boundary schemes of lattice Boltzmann methods
